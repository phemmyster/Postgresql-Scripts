Select location from employee;
select distinct location from employee;
select distinct dept from employee;

select count(distinct dept) from employee;

ORDER BY - Sort the Data, arrange the data in a sequence, either ascending order (default) or in descending order (desc)
select f_nm from employee;
select f_nm from employee order by f_nm;
select f_nm from employee order by f_nm desc;
select f_nm from employee order by age;
select f_nm from employee order by age desc;
select * from employee order by age, salary;  ---second level sort will happen incase of a clash.

LIMIT - to put a limit on the number of records to be fetched (filter - eliminate what is not required)
select * from employee limit 3;
select * from employee order by salary limit 3;  - Bottom 3 employees by Salary
select * from employee order by salary desc limit 3; - Top 3 employees by Salary
select * from employee order by age limit 5; 
select * from employee order by age,salary limit 4;

select id,f_nm,l_nm from employee order by id limit 1 offset 0;  --- gives the first record
select id,f_nm,l_nm from employee order by id limit 3 offset 3;  --- beginning in the 4th place it will give 3 records.

AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS - Sum, Avg, Min, Max, Count, Count Distinct ....
To get the total number of records - select count(*) from employee;
From how many locations are people joining - select count(location) from employee;  
From how many distinct locations are people joining - select count(distinct location) from employee;
To give an alias name to the column - select count(distinct location) as num_of_locations from employee;
To get the number of people above 30 years - select count(f_nm) from employee where age>30;
select count(f_nm) from employee where age>25 and age <35;

Total salaries being paid to employees - select sum(salary) from employee;
Average of the salaries being paid to the employees - select avg(salary) from employee;
similarly minimum and maximum also can be done.

Identify the youngest employee - select min(age) from employee;  gives the minimum age, but to know who is the employee - select f_nm, l_nm from employee order by age limit 1;
